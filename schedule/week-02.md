  - 2: Studying Decision-Making

### Assignments due

1.  Pick a cognitive bias from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). Create a slide to present in class that explains the bias and how it might impact usersâ€™ security or privacy behavior (or the study of that behavior).

1.  Please spend a few minutes writing down your thoughts to each of these questions. Be prepared to share the answers to the first two questions with the class.

	1.  > What are some examples of security interfaces that you use in your daily life that lead to irrational behaviors? (You may start with the examples you and your classmates came up with last week.)

	1.  > What specific biases might impact computer security decision-making and how?

	1.  > What sort of problems are IRBs likely to prevent?

	1.  > What problems are they unlikely to prevent?

	1.  > Should private companies use IRBs for their human-subjects research?

Please upload both files (your slides and a PDF of the document where you wrote your answers to the questions above) in slot "*Assignment 2*" in ISVC.

Also: remember to work on your IRB training, due on [Week 4](./schedule/week-04.md).
